
# Optimal Tic Tac Toe AI – CS50 AI (Minimax)

---

# Description  
A Python program that plays Tic Tac Toe optimally using the **Minimax algorithm**.  
The AI evaluates all possible future game states to choose the best move, ensuring it never loses — resulting in either a win or a tie.  
The game can be played in the terminal or via a graphical interface, for interactive play.

## **Key CS/AI Concepts**
- **Game theory modeling** – representing Tic Tac Toe as a two-player, zero-sum game.  
- **Minimax algorithm** – recursively exploring all possible future moves, building a game tree to select the optimal one.  
- **Recursion and backtracking** – traversing the game tree for decision-making.  
- **Terminal state evaluation** – determining win, loss, or draw from a given board state.
